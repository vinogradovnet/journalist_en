# 7. How do we prepare the game?

Approximate order of actions:

1. Choose the topic of the game.
2. Determine the date of its holding.
3. Compile a list of organizations that can be visited together with children. We start negotiations with the organizations. If we plan to visit not an organization but some locations (like a neighboring yard or park), then we come up with who might be there at the right time.
4. Prepare advertising materials and transfer them to the schools of the region.
5. Think over the program for the second half of the game day (the plan can change for every next game, depending on the theme of the game).
6. Accept applications from future participants of the game.
7. Discuss the general course of the game with the potential adult guides who would accompany the teenagers.
8. Check the equipment, availability of the necessary programs (software), readiness of audience rooms.
9. Make an agreement with the canteen, as lunch is an important part of the 8-hour active game.
10. Print information materials and route sheets for accompanying persons, where we must specify the addresses of the places of visit, group lists and contact numbers of the organizers.
11. Having completed the correspondence registration of participants, we form editorial groups, so that each of them would comprise students from different schools.
12. Look forward to the start of the game with great interest!
