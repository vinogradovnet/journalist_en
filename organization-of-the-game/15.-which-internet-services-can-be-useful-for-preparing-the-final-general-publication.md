# 15. Which Internet services can be useful for preparing the final general publication?

Over the years of the educational game "Journalist", the approaches and tools for creating journalistic materials have changed. The game has successfully moved to new rails and proved it’s being successful in the development of social journalism skills; the game is well guided at present by the wish of many people to instantly spread information in social networks. It is difficult to imagine team interaction, productive work and publication of materials without using the Internet. Our experience shows that the Internet is useful for the game and gives it the necessary dynamics.

Most likely, you will need:

* [cloud-based file storage](15.-which-internet-services-can-be-useful-for-preparing-the-final-general-publication.md#cloud);
* [social network](15.-which-internet-services-can-be-useful-for-preparing-the-final-general-publication.md#social);
* [platform for publication of results](15.-which-internet-services-can-be-useful-for-preparing-the-final-general-publication.md#publication).

Cloud File Storage\
{#cloud}

To organize the event, as well as store the information received and created, you need to select an Internet service that allows you to organize file sharing. These will be press releases, logos of partners, lists of participants, certificate forms and other materials. For this purpose, any cloud storage, such as [Microsoft OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) or [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com), is suitable. But it is better if this service has at least minimal functions that facilitate the planning and organization of the entire game, the ability to enter contact information and compile task lists. At the time of this writing, the authors have opted for the cloud-based [OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com) service, which schools and non-profit organizations can use for free. There it is easy to collect all the necessary files within the project and provide participants access to them.

## Social networks

The participating teams need a platform for quick communication, saving notes and photos. With this function, social networks are quite manageable; they are easy to use from your mobile phone. It's better if it's an open group, in which participants are pre-registered. Using predefined hashtags, they can publish texts, photos, videos and live broadcasts from the event site to this group. It is easy to return to such travel notes later when composing the final materials. It is equally important that all participants and organizers see what is going on at their colleagues’ and are fond of the feeling of a common cause. We opted for [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) and created a group of [www.facebook.com/groups/journalistgame](https://www.facebook.com/groups/journalistgame), but you need to take into account that the popularity of a particular network among adolescents may differ in different regions.

## Platform for publication of results

{#publication}

The results of the work of young journalists should be published on the Internet so that they can be immediately accessible to participants, partners and parents. To do this, you can use social networks, but, in our opinion, they do not provide sufficient opportunities for registration and are not perceived as a source of serious long-term information. The latter is especially important for teams because they are trying to create a product and would like to see their work not lost in the huge stream of current news. That's why it's better to connect to one of the many blog platforms or create a website, links to which you can leave in social networks to reach a larger audience. It would be good if the site will provide an opportunity for joint editing, multi-level moderation of the material, so that editors or organizers can get acquainted with the material before publishing it. It is also convenient when the platform has a mobile application that allows you to work on the go. There are a lot of such platforms (including [Blogger](https://blogger.com), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com), [Wix](http://wix.com), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com)), but we chose [Medium](https://medium.com), it's easy to create professional materials without too much effort. You can bind an account in Medium to your own domain and split articles into categories, as it is done on our page [j.experts-edu.org](https://j.experts-edu.org).
