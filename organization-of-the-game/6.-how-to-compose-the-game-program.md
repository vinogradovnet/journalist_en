# 6. How to compose the game program?

The main technological idea of the game is to create a real journalistic product in a limited time frame. Later in this section we will discuss the standard version of the game that leads to preparation of a printed newspaper, but all the same stages are applicable to electronic publications.

The game takes one day, or, in a special-themed case, two. Provided good technical and personnel support, it is possible to create a newspaper consisting of, say, eight pages, in this time. To do this, it is necessary to involve forces of approximately seven journalistic brigades (5-7 people each), two leading organizers and one layout worker (professional or student), and to provide the participants with appropriate computer and copying equipment. For many years of holding the game, we got convinced that a layout work can be done by somebody of the participants of the game. As far as we decide this way, then it is good when every journalistic brigade would have at least one layout worker.
