# 13.  How can you decorate the headquarter?

The decoration of the game headquarter is an important part of the activity, which helps the participants both to get working drive and to navigate in an unfamiliar place and situation. Pointing arrows, labels for working spaces of the editor offices, a banner with the theme of the game, posters and booklets with the game "Journalist"'s logotype, â€“ all these attributes should be prepared in advance.

In the point of the general assembly (that is hall or auditorium) space should be organized so as to have a notional scene for organizers and guests, and chairs for the participants placed in a semicircle opposite to it. Such space organization is flexible and allows us to transform the space for every step, from tune-up and acquaintances up to press conference and summarizing.
