# 23. What roles do we have in an editorial team?

As far as we play an editorial team releasing a common publication then the game supervisor takes a role of chief editor. Consequently, organizers also can take roles of main layout designer, chief of photo service or other specialists. It entirely depends on imagination and possibilities of the colleagues.

It is important that in every journalist team somebody becomes an editor of a section (page), while the others make a layout, make proofs or work as staff photographers. And, certainly, nobody can imagine the edition without reporters and interviewers who provide the content of the page â€” journalist texts.
