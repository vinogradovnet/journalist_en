# 22. How can you harmonize the playing and professional sides of a game?

While the participants create journalist materials all by themselves — maybe with the help of consultants — it is important to keep the balance between traditional-routine and original-art in the verbal stylistics, between descriptive and explanatory in a manner of representation and types of text production. It is also desirable to have a gust of word aesthetics which will help to find the right place for the words in the text because that is what creates the intonational coloration of text.

The participants are not to be timid at the first steps of author's publicity (game grants you right to mistake) or saucily try to be clever from hearsay. If they want to get a high-quality result of their work they should not follow a free stream of consciousness as well. Whenever possible they should shy away from thrusting of religious, political and scientific catchalls to a reader, even if the author himself is a fervent supporter of the idea. Authenticity grows from listening attentively and silently to the author's own impressions from the place visited, then expressing them in a simple style and adjustment with probable co-authors from the journalist team.
