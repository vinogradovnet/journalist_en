# 29. Who invented the educational game "Journalist"?

The authors of the idea of the educational game as a resource for involving teenagers in a thoughtful exploration of their surrounding space are Valery Puzyrevsky and Mikhail Epshtein, employees of the St. Petersburg Educational Center "Uchastie." They also worked out the technology of preparation and conduct of the game. For the first time, the game was held in 2005. Grigory Ivashchenko, the professional publisher, actively helped in preparation and conduct of the game. Since that time, the Center "Uchastie" has managed to train many colleagues in different Russian cities. The spread of the game was greatly facilitated by its holding in a distant format, co-developed together with Alexandra Tesakova.
