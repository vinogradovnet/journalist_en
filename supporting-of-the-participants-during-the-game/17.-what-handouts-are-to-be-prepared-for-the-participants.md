# 17. What handouts are to be prepared for the participants?

Before each game alongside with application form admission and participant registration list compilation, organizers form handout package, including

1. Participant's starting profile
2. Program of the game
3. Basic principles of news office operating
4. Exploration perspectives
5. Information sheet on short format journalistic genres
6. Log sheet
7. Itinerary list with contact information
8. Resulting participant profile

Examples of these materials are shown in [Question No 30](../30.-where-can-the-example-be-viewed/).

You can add to the package a pen and a notebook, for example, with some promotional information significant for the organizers. If it is not the first game, it could be a good idea to add the newspaper with the materials of the previous games as well.
