# 19. How can you thank the participants?

The key emotional moment at the final stage of the game **** is the **presentation of certificates for the participants and testimonials for schools**. In this regard, it's necessary to prepare conforming formsheets and compose soft-form text pattern in advance. These papers are printed a day before the game or even at the time when you will have more or less definitive list of the participants and their schools.

Most significantly, you would thank the partners of the game - the organizations (enterprises, firms, museums, public offices), which embarked to put up the students, answer their questions and contact with them on equal terms. When such a cooperation arises, it's a benefit for both sides: organizers get the partner for the further games and other educational projects, and the organization obtains reflection in mass media and a possibility to see itself from outside.

As a rule, on completing the game we print our thanks to the partners on the special blanks and pass them coupled with the newspaper release. Refer to the [Question No 30](../30.-where-can-the-example-be-viewed.md) for all typography examples.
