## THE EDUCATIONAL GAME "JOURNALIST" IN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

The game "Journalist" has established itself as one of the complex forms of intensive additional education, as the way of an active and reflexive acquaintance of high school students with the world around them.

The game effectively develops its participants in the field of substantive training (improving journalistic skills, mastering literary genres), and in the field of social competencies (communication skills, teamwork, the ability to quickly assess the situation, the ability to formulate and defend one's point of view), and in the field of better understanding of how the contemporary world functions, as well as in the sphere of personal self-understanding. The game teaches to see special things in everyday life, something that looks amazing and fascinating in ordinary things and ways, as well as to tell other people about this.

At the same time, the game can have a direct impact on local life, on the degree of its openness, on how much public dialogue is involved in solving actual problems of local life. The game helps to establish closer links between education and other spheres of public life in a city or region.

The game can be conducted on the basis of a school, a university, an organization of additional education, editorial offices of local media and local authorities.
